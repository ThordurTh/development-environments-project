            "Kongebrogaarden is a very special place with peace, aesthetics and atmosphere.\n\nFrom 1584 the place functioned as a service/crossing/shipping point for King Frederik II. Since then, the King's son, the well-known Christian IV, also used the place. From 1812 Kongebrogaarden became an inn and later a restaurant.\n\nJust a few days after the start of World War I, Danish soldiers were lodged at Kongebrogaarden and all the way up the coast they took in boat refugees - young men from Southern Jutland, who fled from the German war service. During World War II, the place was a popular establishment for the Nazis living there.\n\nIn 2011, Comwell Hotels took ownership of Kongebrogaarden, and in 2018 the hotel was voted for 'Best Luxury Hotel of the Year'.",
